The morning bell
The mourning bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me

{0:50}
You can keep the furniture
[A] bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Please

{1:23}
Release me
Release me

{1:32}
Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
[The] clothes are all over the
Furniture
Now, I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack, the fire drill
Round and round and round and
Round and round and round and round
And round

{2:14}
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

{3:05}
Come to the class, get away from {*}
Walking so far muscles achin[g] {*}
Everyone wants to be a friend and
Nobody wants to be here 'cause
Walking, walking, walking walking
Walking, walking, walking walking
Walking, walking, walking walking
Walking, walking, walking walking
Yeah, who is it coming for?
But lots of trials and error 'cause
What a surprise, level with a
Sinister pride, we'll tell you 'cause
Walking, walking, walking walking
Walking, walking, walking walking
Walking, walking, walking walking
Walking, walking, walking walking
Walking, walking, walk walk
Walking, walking, walking walk
Who has it come for?
Grander scheme
????? {*}
Walking, walking, walk walk
Walking, walking, walk walk
Walking, walking, walk walk
Walking, walking, walk walk
