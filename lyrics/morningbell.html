The morning bell<br>
The mourning bell<br>
Light another candle and<br>
Release me<br>
Release me<br>
<br>
{0:50}<br>
You can keep the furniture<br>
[A] bump on the head<br>
Howling down the chimney<br>
Release me<br>
Release me<br>
Please<br>
<br>
{1:23}<br>
Release me<br>
Release me<br>
<br>

Where'd you park the car?<br>
Where'd you park the car?<br>
[The] clothes are all over the<br>
Furniture<br>
Now, I might as well<br>
I might as well<br>
Sleepy jack, the fire drill<br>
Round and round and round and<br>
Round and round and round and round<br>
And round<br>
<br>
{2:14}<br>
Cut the kids in half<br>
Cut the kids in half<br>
Cut the kids in half<br>

Come to the class, get away from {*}<br>
Walking so far muscles achin[g] {*}<br>
Everyone wants to be a friend and<br>
Nobody wants to be here 'cause<br>
Walking, walking, walking walking<br>
Walking, walking, walking walking<br>
Walking, walking, walking walking<br>
Walking, walking, walking walking<br>
Yeah, who is it coming for?<br>
But lots of trials and error 'cause<br>
What a surprise, level with a<br>
Sinister pride, we'll tell you 'cause<br>
Walking, walking, walking walking<br>
Walking, walking, walking walking<br>
Walking, walking, walking walking<br>
Walking, walking, walking walking<br>
Walking, walking, walk walk<br>
Walking, walking, walking walk<br>

Walking, walking, walk walk<br>
Walking, walking, walk walk<br>
Walking, walking, walk walk<br>
