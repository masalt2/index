{1:45}<br>
While you make pretty speeches<br>
I'm being cut to shreds<br>
You feed me to the lions<br>
A delicate balance<br>
<br>
{2:27}<br>
And this just feels like<br>
Spinning plates<br>
I'm living in cloud<br>
Cuckoo land<br>
And this just feels like<br>
Spinning plates<br>
My body is floating down the muddy river<br>
