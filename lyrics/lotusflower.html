{0:57}
I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want

{1:12}
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into a groove
And cut me out
And cut me off

{1:30}
There's an empty space
Inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I set you free

{1:45}
There's an empty space
Inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I set you free

{2:03}
Slowly we unfurl, as lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is a moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to feel your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart

{2:46}
We will shrink and then be quiet as mice
While the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want

{3:04}
There's an empty space
Inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I set you free

{3:26}
'Cause all I want is a moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
Bird that's flown into my room

{3:51}
Slowly we unfurl, as lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is a moon upon a stick
I'm dancing around a pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
