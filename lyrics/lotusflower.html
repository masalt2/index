{0:57}<br>
I will shape myself into your pocket<br>
Invisible<br>
Do what you want<br>
Do what you want<br>
<br>
{1:12}<br>
I will shrink and I will disappear<br>
I will slip into a groove<br>
And cut me out<br>
And cut me off<br>
<br>
{1:30}<br>
There's an empty space<br>
Inside my heart<br>
Where the weeds take root<br>
So now I set you free<br>
I set you free<br>
<br>
{1:45}<br>
There's an empty space<br>
Inside my heart<br>
Where the weeds take root<br>
So now I set you free<br>
I set you free<br>
<br>
{2:03}<br>
Slowly we unfurl, as lotus flowers<br>
[Be]cause all I want is a moon upon a stick<br>
Just to see what if<br>
Just to see what is<br>
I can't kick your habit<br>
Just to feel your fast ballooning head<br>
Listen to your heart<br>
<br>
{2:46}<br>
We will shrink and then be quiet as mice<br>
While the cat is away<br>
Do what we want<br>
Do what we want<br>
<br>
{3:04}<br>
There's an empty space<br>
Inside my heart<br>
Where the weeds take root<br>
So now I set you free<br>
I set you free<br>
<br>
{3:26}<br>
[Be]cause all I want is a moon upon a stick<br>
Just to see what if<br>
Just to see what is<br>
Bird that's flown into my room<br>
<br>
{3:51}<br>
Slowly we unfurl, as lotus flowers<br>
[Be]cause all I want is a moon upon a stick<br>
I'm dancing around a pit<br>
The darkness is beneath<br>
I can't kick your habit<br>
Just to feed your fast ballooning head<br>
Listen to your heart<br>
